# WaTur: Water turbidity dataset
This is the repository for the data around the Paper 880 from the BMVC called Estimating Water Turbidity From A Smartphone Camera


The files included in the repository are the following:
- Train and Testing Image Dataset
- Preparation of Kaolin Clay and Formazine

**Formazine and kaolin clay stock preparation**

A stock solution of hydrazine was prepared at 1,000 mg/L and a stock solution of hexamethylenetetramine was prepared at a 10,000 mg/L. A mixture between hydrazine and hexamethylenetetramine, 5mL each and 90mL of distilled water, was used to prepare a standard formazine solution of 400 NTU turbidity. The mixture was then diluted with distilled water to provide a wide range of turbidity standards eg. for 5 NTU 2000 mL, 25 mL of stock solution and 1975 mL of water were mixed.

Kaolin clay solution of 1000 NTU 1,074 mg of kaolin clay was mixed with 1000 mL of distilled water. Different levels of NTU were then prepared by diluting with distilled
water. For coloured water samples Methyl orange 500 mg/L was prepared from methyl orange powder. The stock solution was then diluted to prepare 1 ppm, 2.5 ppm, and 5 ppm.
